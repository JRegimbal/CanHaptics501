/**
** Usage **
This sketch contains 3 different modes which are called 1, 2, and 3.
By default, the program starts in mode 1. The mode can be switched by
pressing the corresponding key on the keyboard. For example, to switch to mode
2, press the 2 key.

By default, the first available serial port is used for the Haply. To change this,
go to line 87 and replace "Serial.list()[0]" with the correct identifier for your
system.

** Instructions **
Using the Haply, explore the different modes.
Once you feel like you've fully explored them, list three adjectives for each mode.
These should be the adjectives for your experience of using each mode.
For example, the adjective you feel best describes the mode should be listed first,
the next best adjective second, and so on.

Mode 1:
1.
2.
3.

Mode 2:
1.
2.
3.

Mode 3:
1.
2.
3.

Optionally, if you feel that the experience that is being attempted significantly differs
from the experience actually conveyed, you can note what you believe was attempted
to be conveyed.

Mode 1:
Mode 2:
Mode 3:
